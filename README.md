# **ArgusAI**

**ArgusAI** is an artificial intelligence project focused on developing a custom architecture for object detection. Inspired by the legendary **Argus Panoptes** from Greek mythology, renowned for his countless vigilant eyes, the project combines advanced computer vision techniques and neural networks to identify and locate objects in images with precision.

## **Main Objectives**
- Build a custom object detection model architecture using **Python** and **PyTorch**.
- Implement a complete pipeline, including:
  - **Data loading and preprocessing**.
  - **Model training** with public or custom datasets.
  - **Validation and evaluation metrics**, such as IoU (Intersection over Union).
- Optimize the model for real-time applications.

## **Features**
- Supports detection of multiple object classes.
- Generates **bounding boxes** with confidence scores.
- Adaptable training pipeline for custom datasets.
- Easy integration with other Python-based applications.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python** for developing the pipeline.
- **PyTorch** as the main framework for neural networks.
- **OpenCV** for image manipulation.
- **LabelImg** for annotating custom datasets.
